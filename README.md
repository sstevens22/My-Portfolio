# My-Portfolio
Built my First Website!

# Portfolio
This is my portfolio where I will showcase all of my work! Not only do I have my Webisites and all Coding related content, I also have links to some of my other creative projects.

## Usage
This Website is mainly an informational page that tells readers about who I am, gives them a sneak peak into my coding progress, and provides links to other platforms that showcase my work as well as how to reach me!
